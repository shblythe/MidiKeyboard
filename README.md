# What?

This project is reimplementation of a cheap Midi keyboard's processor board using an Arduino.

# Why?

Because I bought a cheap Midi keyboard, and the software was terrible, and the incorrect version for the keyboard I bought.

I couldn't find a way to reprogram it, so I ripped the hardware out and, as Zaphod Beeblebrox would say, gave it a reprogramming it would never forget.

If you are making your own Midi keyboard, or you're in a similar position to the above, you might find this useful, or indeed fun.
